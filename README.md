(This is good if you want examples on how to integrate custom HDL modules into a NIOS based system)

1. Download and install Quartus Prime Lite w/ MAX 10 FPGA device support package.
2. Download and install Arrow USB Programmer Drivers
3. Start using Quartus!


----Development Pitfalls----

These are embarrassing, but in case someone like me is just starting out with no prior experience with FPGAs, this might help getting started with the Max1000.

1. MAKE SURE YOUR USB CABLE ISN'T JUST 5V & GND. I was using this crappy charging cable and scratched my head longer than I'd like to      admit.

2. If you're using a few of the onboard LEDs and some of the LEDs are receiving phantom power (the unused LEDs are dim). To fix this go    to

      "Assignment>Device>Device and Pin Options>Unused Pins>Reserve all unused pins"
   
   and change the drop down to "As input tri-stated."

4. When using NIOS you may get memory initialization errors during Quartus compilation, navigate to 

      "Assignment>Device>Device and Pin Options>Configuration>Configuration>Configuration mode"

   and change the drop down to "Single Uncompressed Image with Memory Initialization."
   
3. Before you can download an elf application file from Eclipse to NIOS, you must change the JTAG TCK. Intel UART JTAG IP input    clock 
   needs to be at least double (2x) the operating frequency of JTAG TCK on board. For instruction on how to set the JTAG TCK          
   navigate to C:\intelFPGA_lite\17.0\nios2eds and run the Nios II Command Shell.bat then execute 

      jtagconfig --setparam <cable number> JtagClock <frequency><unit prefix>
   
   To get cable number...
   
      jtagconfig -n




Hopefully this helps you get started!!!
