# Microprocessor Lab Examples
Lab examples will be in the [labs](/labs) folder. Each lab contains hardware files in the root directory and software directory (except the analog to digital lab). Additionally there is a Quartus archive file (.qar) of the working project. Instructions can be found in the (student guides) [student guides](Max1000-FPGA-Senior-Design-Verilog-Code/student-guides/) on how to complete the labs using the provided source files. The [Test projects](test-projects) folder contains my first successful projects using NIOS and is included to provide some additional resources.
