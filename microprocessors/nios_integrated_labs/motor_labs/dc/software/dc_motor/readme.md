Readme - DC motor controller

DESCRIPTION:
This application utilizes the Altera small C library to get user inputs and translate them to data that is then sent to the memory mapped hardware modules. Some already existing C function had to be recreated due to the limitations of the Altera small C library, see NIOS Software Developer Handbook for more info. DC motor speed is controlled by applying a PWM signal to the enable pins on a Half-H driver (SN754410NE in this case). The speed_controller.v module is responsible for generating this PWM signal through a register counting system. The direction at which the motor spins depends on how the A inputs on the Half-H driver. The responsibility of this application is to read user input from the NIOS console and convert it to an unsigned 8bit value for the speed and direction (only the LSB is sent to the direction module) control modules. A list of settings that were supplied are then displayed, and the user is prompted to enter a new frequency and direction.
